 user stories that follow the format of “As a ___, I need to be able to ___ because of ____"
As a Captain, I need to be able to Add Players, because I’m a quidditch captain who wants to build a team.
As a Team, I need to be able to Pick Players because I need to have a good team with a full roster to play.
As a Team, I need to be able to See Player Attributes because I need to be able to make the right choice when it comes to picking a player.
As a Team, I need to be able to Pick Which House I Want To Pick A Player From because I can’t pick a wizard or witch from a different house. That would be awkward and against the rules.
As a Team, I need to be able to Sort Players By Player Attributes  because I would like to be able to determine what I am looking for when I am choosing a player.
As a Team, I need to be able to Delete Players because sometimes people quit or decide not to play anymore (or worse) and I need to be able to make room for the next player.
As a Player, I need to be able to Add Myself To The Roster Of Recruits because this is a creator app and that is the selling point of the game is to create yourself and be apart of a quidditch team.
As a Player, I need to be able to Change My Physical Attributes because this app is about customization and personalization and being able to change how you look is a huge part of that selling point.
As a Player, I need to be able to  Update My Attributes(Maybe Just Broom On Player And All On Physical) because I know as a person I can change how I look and want to be able to do so when I please in this app.


These stories will be broken down into tasks, sorted by feature or functionality, and divvied out to devs. (Trello?)
